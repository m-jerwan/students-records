# students-records

// js will display student records database in the browser in flexbox divs.

//unique: jS is dynamic and will react to changes in the number of students arrays in the two-dimensional array studentRecords.
//jS will create as many flexbox-divs as there is students, and then fill them [loop] with students data.  

// All function elements are connected, which means they work great together, but will
// not be able to extract it and use somewhere else without syntax changes. Also,
//error are snowballing.
